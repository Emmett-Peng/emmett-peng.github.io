Hi, I am **Yiming (Emmett) Peng**, a second-year MSc Biostatistics student at the University of Toronto, Dalla Lana School of Public Health. I am currently pursuing my thesis under the supervision of **Dr. Kuan Liu**](https://www.kuan-liu.com/) and **Dr. Zihang Lu**(https://phs.queensu.ca/faculty-research/zihang-lu). I also have the privilege to work as a **Research Analyst** at the Neurosciences & Mental Health research program, The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), with **Dr. Andrea Knight**(https://lab.research.sickkids.ca/knight/), and as a **Research Volunteer** with **Dr. Amanda Ricciuto**(https://www.sickkids.ca/en/staff/r/amanda-ricciuto/) and **Dr. Anne Griffiths**. During my MSc practicum, I was fortunate to work with **Dr. Pingzhao Hu**(https://phulab.org/) on projects combining large language models and single-cell transcriptomics.

My research spans **causal inference, latent class analysis, and the use of statistical machine learning in health data science**. I am particularly fascinated by developing methods at the intersection of disciplines that combine statistical rigor with scalability and interpretability.

I am a student member of the **Health Data Working Group**(https://health-data-working-group.github.io/) at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health. Within my department, I serve as an MSc Representative (2025–2026) and as a Seminar Committee member (2024–2025) for the **Biostatistics Union of Graduate Students (BUGS)**(https://biostatistics-union-of-grad-students.github.io/about).

Beyond research, I enjoy live concerts, traveling, and playing football and badminton.
